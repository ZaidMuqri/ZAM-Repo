        <h1>Git/GitHub</h1>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration and maintaining a history of modifications.</p>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment for developers. It hosts repositories, allowing users to share code, manage projects, and collaborate with others through features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews.</p>
